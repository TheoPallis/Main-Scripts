Audit:

Unused variables: The variables "antidikos_z", "paragraph_dict", and "test_df" are defined but not used anywhere in the code. These variables can be removed to improve code readability and maintainability. Severity: Low. Proposed resolution: Remove the unused variables.
Unnecessary reset_index(): The line "test_df.reset_index(drop=True)" is unnecessary as the DataFrame "test_df" is not used anywhere in the code. This line can be removed. Severity: Low. Proposed resolution: Remove the line "test_df.reset_index(drop=True)".
Missing import statement: The code uses the "pd" module, but there is no import statement for it. This will result in a NameError when executing the code. Severity: High. Proposed resolution: Add the import statement "import pandas as pd" at the beginning of the code.
Missing variable assignment: The variable "file_list" is used in the for loop, but it is not defined anywhere in the code. This will result in a NameError when executing the code. Severity: High. Proposed resolution: Define the variable "file_list" and assign it the appropriate value before the for loop.
Missing import statement: The code uses the "re" module, but there is no import statement for it. This will result in a NameError when executing the code. Severity: High. Proposed resolution: Add the import statement "import re" at the beginning of the code.
Incorrect regular expression: The regular expression "reg_date" is defined but not used anywhere in the code. Severity: Low. Proposed resolution: Remove the regular expression "reg_date" if it is not needed.
Incorrect regular expression: The regular expression "reg_name" is used to find a pattern in the text, but it is not defined correctly. The pattern should be enclosed in parentheses to capture the matched text. Severity: Medium. Proposed resolution: Modify the regular expression "reg_name" to "(?<=ΚΑΤΑ)(.*?)(?=ΕΙΣΑΓΩΓΙΚΑ)".
Unnecessary list conversion: The line "s_name = str(name)" converts the list "name" to a string unnecessarily. Severity: Low. Proposed resolution: Remove the line "s_name = str(name)".
Incorrect list indexing: The lines "antidikos_1.append(s_name[tou_index[0] :tou_index[1] -1])", "antidikos_2.append(s_name[tou_index[1]: tou_index[2] -1])", and "antidikos_3.append(s_name[tou_index[2] : ])" use incorrect list indexing. The index should be inclusive, so the "-1" should be removed. Severity: Medium. Proposed resolution: Modify the lines to "antidikos_1.append(s_name[tou_index[0]:tou_index[1]])", "antidikos_2.append(s_name[tou_index[1]:tou_index[2]])", and "antidikos_3.append(s_name[tou_index[2]:])".
Incorrect condition check: The condition "if len(tou_index) == 3 and name != []:" is incorrect. The variable "name" is a list, so it will never be equal to an empty list. Severity: Medium. Proposed resolution: Modify the condition to "if len(tou_index) == 3 and len(name) != 0:".
Incorrect condition check: The condition "elif len(tou_index) == 2 and date != [] and name != []:" is incorrect. The variable "date" is a string, so it will never be equal to an empty list. Severity: Medium. Proposed resolution: Modify the condition to "elif len(tou_index) == 2 and date != '' and len(name) != 0:".
Incorrect condition check: The condition "elif len(tou_index) == 1 and date != [] and name != []:" is incorrect. The variable "date" is a string, so it will never be equal to an empty list. Severity: Medium. Proposed resolution: Modify the condition to "elif len(tou_index) == 1 and date != '' and len(name) != 0:".
Incorrect condition check: The condition "elif name == []:" is incorrect. The variable "name" is a list, so it will never be equal to an empty list. Severity: Medium. Proposed resolution: Modify the condition to "elif len(name) == 0:".
Incorrect condition check: The condition "else:" is incorrect. The variable "name" is a list, so it will never be equal to an empty list. Severity: Medium. Proposed resolution: Modify the condition to "else:".
Unhandled exception: The code uses a generic exception handler "except Exception as e:" without specifying the specific exception to handle. This can lead to unexpected behavior and make it difficult to debug errors. Severity: Medium. Proposed resolution: Specify the specific exception to handle or remove the generic exception handler if not needed.
Overall severity rating: Medium.
